  Analyze skill outcomes and user corrections to propose self-improvements. Use when a skill's output repeatedly needs manual fixes, after a grill session surfaces skill weaknesses, or on a schedule to continuously improve skill quality. Triggers on: improve, skill learning, why does this skill keep getting it wrong, make this skill better.

# Improve — Skill Learning Loop

## Usage

```
/improve <skill-name>        # Improve a specific skill
/improve                     # Scan all outcome logs, rank by error rate, suggest which to improve
```

## Vault paths

- Outcome logs: `{vault}/daily/skill-outcomes/`
- Grill sessions: `{vault}/daily/grill-sessions/`
- Aha moments: `{vault}/thinking/aha/`
- Reports: `{vault}/daily/improve-reports/`

---

## Phase 1 — Collect signals (deterministic)

When invoked without a skill name, scan all outcome logs, rank skills by `partial` + `fail` rate, and recommend the top candidate. Stop and report.

When invoked with a skill name:

1. **Read outcome log** at `{vault}/daily/skill-outcomes/{skill}.log`
   - Format: `date | skill | action | source_repo | output_path | commit:hash | result [| key=value ...]`
   - 7 required pipe-delimited fields, then optional trailing `key=value` fields (also pipe-delimited)
   - result = `pass`, `partial`, or `fail`
   - Optional trailing fields (per `skill-spec.md § 11`):
     - `corrections=N` → weight signal: higher N = stronger failure pattern, prioritize in Phase 2
     - `args="..."` → original input/topic — replay as eval case in Phase 3
     - `score=N.N` → rubric score from evaluator skill — correlate with result (partial+score=9.5 differs from partial+score=6.1)
     - `interrupt="..."` → user-stated reason for stopping — feed into Phase 2 as explicit failure reason
   - Unknown keys are ignored (forward-compat for future fields)
   - If trailing fields are absent, parse the 7 required fields only (backwards-compat with old log lines)
   - If no log exists, report "no outcome data yet" and stop

2. **Read trace files** (if available) at `{vault}/daily/skill-traces/{skill}.jsonl`
   - JSONL format: each line is a tool call record with `ts`, `event`, `tool`, `session`, `input` fields
   - Use traces to understand behavioral patterns: which tools the skill calls, in what order, and what inputs it uses
   - Correlate trace sessions with outcome log entries by timestamp proximity
   - If no trace file exists, skip — traces are supplementary, not required

3. **Scan grill sessions** — grep `{vault}/daily/grill-sessions/` for mentions of the skill name

4. **Scan aha moments** — grep `{vault}/thinking/aha/` for mentions of the skill name

5. **Detect user corrections via git diff** — for each outcome log entry with a commit hash:
   - In the repo that contains the output file, check if the same file was modified in a later commit by the user (not by the skill)
   - If yes, `git diff <skill-commit>..<user-commit> -- <output_path>` to capture what changed
   - **Filter cosmetic diffs:** skip entries where the diff is only whitespace, typos, or formatting. Only keep substantive content changes (added/removed paragraphs, reworded arguments, structural changes).

---

## Phase 2 — Extract patterns (latent — use judgment)

Read all collected signals. Synthesize into patterns:

- What does the skill consistently get wrong?
- What do user corrections have in common?
- What did grill sessions or aha moments flag?
- Weight by `corrections=N` — entries with higher N represent stronger failure signals
- Use `interrupt="..."` values as explicit failure reasons (user told you what went wrong)
- Use `score=N.N` to distinguish severity: a `partial` with score 9.0 is cosmetic; a `partial` with score 5.0 is structural
- Cross-reference trace files for behavioral patterns (e.g., skill always calls tool X before failing)

### Trace-based process detectors

When trace data exists, run these detectors against the JSONL tool-call sequence. Each detector is an IF/THEN rule — if the condition matches, emit a pattern. Weight trace-derived patterns **lower than direct user corrections** (`corrections=N`) but **higher than zero-signal inference**.

If no trace file exists, skip this subsection entirely — Phase 2 still works from outcome logs alone.

**Detector 1 — Skipped vault-first lookup**
IF trace shows `WebSearch` or `WebFetch` tool calls WITHOUT a prior `Grep` or `Read` targeting vault paths (e.g., `~/work/brain/`, `{vault}/`)
THEN → `Pattern: skill searches web before checking vault → should grep vault first per brain-first lookup rule`

**Detector 2 — Over-read context**
IF trace shows ≥10 `Read` calls in a single session, OR any `Read` call with line range >500 lines, OR repeated reads of the same file
THEN → `Pattern: skill reads excessive context ({N} reads / {M} lines) → should read targeted sections only`

**Detector 3 — Skipped research before action**
IF trace shows `Edit` or `Write` calls WITHOUT prior `Read`/`Grep`/`Glob` calls for spec or reference files in the same skill directory
THEN → `Pattern: skill jumps to editing without reading specs/references → should consult skill references before producing output`

**Detector 4 — Missing spec consultation**
IF the skill has `references/` files and trace shows zero `Read` calls to any file under `skills/{skill}/references/`
THEN → `Pattern: skill ignores its own reference files → should read references/ before generating output`

New detectors can be added following the same IF/THEN format.

Write each pattern as: `Pattern: <what happens> → <what user wants instead>`

---

## Phase 3 — Generate evals from corrections (deterministic)

For each substantive user correction found in Phase 1:

1. Extract the original prompt/input that triggered the skill — prefer `args="..."` from the outcome log (exact input), fall back to git log message
2. The skill's output = the failing case
3. The user's corrected version = the expected output
4. Generate an assertion from the diff pattern (e.g., "must include company-specific example", "must not name frameworks by author")

Write evals to `evals/evals.json` in the skill's source directory. Append to existing evals, don't overwrite.

---

## Phase 4 — Improve the skill (latent + deterministic)

1. **Locate the skill source** — read the `source_repo` field from the outcome log. The SKILL.md to edit is at `{source_repo}/skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`
2. **Run existing evals** as "before" baseline. Record pass count.
3. **Git tag** `pre-improve-vN` in the source repo (N = increment from last tag)
4. **Edit SKILL.md** — translate patterns into new rules or gotchas. Add to the appropriate section. Don't restructure the entire skill — surgical additions only.
5. **Run evals again** as "after". Record pass count.
6. **Eval gate:**
   - If after >= before → keep changes, commit with message `improve: {skill} — {one-line summary}`
   - If after < before → `git checkout -- skills/{skill}/SKILL.md`, report what was tried and why it failed

---

## Phase 5 — Report

Write report to `{vault}/daily/improve-reports/{date}-{skill}.md`:

```markdown
# Improve Report: {skill} — {date}

## Signals analyzed
- {N} outcome log entries ({X} partial, {Y} fail, {Z} pass)
- {N} grill sessions mentioning {skill}
- {N} aha moments mentioning {skill}
- {N} user corrections detected

## Patterns found
- Pattern: {description} ({N} occurrences)

## Changes made
- {what was added/modified in SKILL.md}

## Eval results
- Before: {X}/{Y} pass ({percent}%)
- After: {X}/{Y} pass ({percent}%)
- Decision: KEPT / REVERTED

## Auto-generated evals
- {N} new eval cases added from user corrections
```

Commit and push the report to the vault.

---

## Gotchas

- NEVER edit installed plugin copies (`~/.claude/plugins/`). Always edit the source repo. The `source_repo` field in the outcome log points to the right place.
- When editing SKILL.md, keep changes surgical. Don't rewrite sections that aren't related to the patterns found.
- The eval gate is non-negotiable. If evals drop, revert. No exceptions.
- A skill with zero outcome log entries has nothing to improve — say so and stop. Don't hallucinate patterns.

---

## Outcome log

Follow `skill-spec.md § 11`. Append to `{vault}/daily/skill-outcomes/improve.log`:

```
{date} | improve | improve | ~/work/brain-os-plugin | daily/improve-reports/{date}-{skill}.md | commit:{hash} | {result}
```

- `result`: `pass` if evals improved and changes kept, `partial` if changes reverted (evals dropped), `fail` if no outcome data
- Optional: `args="{skill-name}"`, `score={after_pass}/{after_total}`
